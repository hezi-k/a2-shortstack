## WPI Football

WPI Football seeks to address the need of organising pick up football in WPI. Currently the system is set up on messenger. Someone will send a message asking to play and people respond accordingly. However the system can be confusing and convoluted. I would really like to develop this website further. As a starter, I wanted to create a system where other players can check eachother out and see simple things like their name and their stats. I wanted to make this on a separate page however I could not figure out how to do this with the sever. You can see the commented out code in the respective files. I would like to make this more robust and let people add more stats or even profile pictures. For now a user is able to put in their username, password and some basic stats and this is displayed in a table below. However, I think this has a lot of potential.

One other future I could not figure out was how to delete an entry, with a button. However, I think I need to spend more time on this.
